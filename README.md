# Foam Beer Properties Detection

This repository contains code designed to detect and analyze various properties of beer foam. The main features include:

- **Medium Radius of the Bubbles in the Foam**
- **Decay of Foam Height**
- **Bubble Density**

## Features

### Medium Radius of the Bubbles
Calculates the average radius of the bubbles present in the beer foam. This can be useful for understanding the texture and consistency of the foam.

### Decay of Foam Height
Measures the rate at which the foam height decreases over time. This property is important for determining the stability of the foam.

### Bubble Density
Analyzes the density of bubbles within a given volume of foam, providing insights into the foam's overall structure and quality.
